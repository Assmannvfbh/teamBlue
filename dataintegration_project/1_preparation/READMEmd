In order to load data from the csv sheets, I used a libary called: "tablesaw".
This libary allows me to store the csv in a table like data structure.
It provides dataclasses and useful functions to access rows and columns.

To see an example of how the code works, open "dataintegration_project" as a new project
and run the code in the "src" folder.
